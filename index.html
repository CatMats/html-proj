    <h2>January 2020, Before School</h2>

    <p>When i was being driven to my High School, The radio was turned on and announced an outbreak starting to occur.
    At first i thought this was just another virus that wouldnt be as severe, and leaning into a common cold kind of situation.
    Little did I know what was bound to happen.</p>

    <h2 >March 13th 2020, 7th Period</h2>

    <p>Going through the school day, i've been hearing alot of friends and students talking about Covid more often because of
    recent news that the first cases have been discovered, Eventually as i reached my 7th Period, I was the earliest student in the class
    , but then <b>BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!</b> The fire alarm went off! and Smoke bombs were set in all bathrooms, i saw it all happening at once
    and even got a glimpse of the commotion outside, this was the last day before we all went remote.</p>

    <h2>2020-2022, Last Years at Highschool + Transition to College</h2>

    <div class = "sad"><p>After that incident, I began to feel a bit disconnected and  anxious of when we will ever be back in school, 
    i miss having contact with peers. Thankfully we inched back by going through a hybrid model throughout my junior year, and 
    then normal during senior, which eventually lead to my path of UIC. This was a big step to take, as I have to commute just about 
    every day and also take more classes at times that aren't usual to have at the time, along with their contents too.</p></div>

    <h2>2022-Present, Final Thoughts </h2>
    <div class = "sad"><p>After that expereince, it comes to show that anything can happen in life and at the most unexpected times 
    too especially. So it's good to be prepared for anything. Other than that, I feel with what's happened, we've all grown a bit
    stronger along the way making this far to become a college student. We should be proud of ourselves for overcoming this event,
    but look out for one another in case of the unknown too. Thank you for reading :)</p></div>
