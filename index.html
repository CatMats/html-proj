    <h2>January 2020, Before School</h2>

    <p>When i was being driven to my High School, The radio was turned on and announced an outbreak starting to occur.
    At first i thought this was just another virus that wouldnt be as severe, and leaning into a common cold kind of situation.
    Little did I know what was bound to happen.</p>

    <h2>Marcch 13th 2020, 7th Period</h2>

    <div class = sad><p>Going through the school day, i've been hearning alot of friends and students talking about Covid more often because of
    recent news that the first cases have been discovered, Eventually as i reached my 7th Period, I was the earliest student in the class
    , but then <b>BEEP BEEP BEEP!!!</b> The fire alarm went off! and Smoke bombs were set in all bathrooms, i saw it all happening at once
    and even got a glimpse of the commotion outside, this was the last day before we all went remote.</p></div>

    <p>After that incident, I began to feel a bit disconnected and  anxious of when we will ever be back in school, i miss having contact
    with peers. Thankfully we inched back by going through a hybrid model throughout my junior year, and then normal during senior, which
    eventually lead to my path of UIC.</p>
